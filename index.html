        <p>My favourite that I've watched recently has to be "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
        I watched it for the first time with my papa because we wanted to spend more quality time together!
        I really enjoyed the movie because it was so so silly and unrealistic but at the same time felt realistic.
        My papa and I we're laughing the whole time and after we talked about how he used to pull a "Ferris Bueller" with his parents.
        The movie itself is very good and funny but, what enhances my experience more is the association it has to my papa!</p>
